version 1.000.000.01

To start enter the number of players and their names in the console. it also shows everyone's moves as well when the game starts.

DON'T be a cunt and enter an invalid number of players. Enter 2 or more players. No more than 18, because there aren't enough cards you poop.

Also cards can only be clicked on the left, so the last card is only clickable for the first 30 pixels or so, so don't fuck up.
